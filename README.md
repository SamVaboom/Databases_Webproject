## Overview

The Bike Sharing Webproject is a database-driven platform that simulates a real bike-sharing company.  
Users can create accounts, select subscription plans, start and end bike rides, report issues, and browse station availability.

Administrators and employees have tools to monitor maintenance cases and manage assets.

The system uses **REST APIs**, **Sequelize ORM**, and **a relational MariaDB database**.
